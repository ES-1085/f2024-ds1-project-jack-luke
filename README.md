# Understanding Pitcher Performance after Pitch Clock Implementation

by Jack and Luke

## Summary

In 2023, Major League Baseball revolutionized the sport by implementing a pitch clock.
Baseball was losing viewership as games became slower and harder to watch, often lasting more than three hours.
Fans were frustrated by the long pauses between pitches, which as a result were leading to extremely long games.
Major League Baseball was also quickly losing viewers due to these long games.
In response, Major League Baseball introduced a pitch clock with the goal of speeding up the game and making it more engaging for both new and lifelong fans.
The new rules gave pitchers 15 seconds to throw when the bases were empty and 20 seconds when runners were on base.
Starting in 2024, the time with runners on was shortened to 18 seconds.
Batters were required to be ready in the box with eight seconds remaining on the pitch clock, or else be charged with an automatic strike.
If the pitcher failed to begin his delivery before the clock expired, an automatic ball would be assessed.
Pitchers were also limited pitchers to two pickoff attempts or step-offs per plate appearance, with a third unsuccessful attempt resulting in the runner automatically advancing.
Major League Baseball’s also adjusted mound visit limit, allowing for an extra visit if a team had used all of its visits before the ninth inning.
These changes were designed to move the game along without disrupting its competitive balance.
The pitch clock did more than just shorten games.
It changed how pitchers approached their work on the mound.
Before the pitch clock, pitchers often used the time between pitches to regain their energy, refocus, and control the pace of the game.
With the new time constraints, pitchers had to adapt both physically and mentally to a faster rhythm.
Managers and front office personnel, therefore, must seek to understand how to adjust their management of players and effects of the new rule on their pitchers.
This adjustment had measurable effects on several key statistics.
One noticeable change was a slight decrease in the percentage of pitches thrown for strikes.
While the overall decline was not dramatic, it was consistent across the league.
This suggests that the reduced time may have made it harder for pitchers to execute their pitches as accurately as before.
Some pitchers who relied on longer pauses to control their tempo were particularly affected.
Another major area of change was pitcher workload.
The average number of innings pitched per game became much more consistent.
Most starting pitchers now average around five and two-thirds innings per outing.
Previously, there had been a wider range, with some starters regularly pitching deep into games while others were pulled earlier.
The standardized pace imposed by the pitch clock meant that pitchers tired more predictably, and managers could plan more consistently for bullpen usage.
ERA, or earned run average, showed interesting results.
While the average ERA across the league stayed roughly the same after the pitch clock was implemented, the spread of ERA values tightened.
Elite performances still occurred, but the gap between the best and worst pitchers became smaller.
This suggests that the pitch clock created an environment where consistency and adaptability were rewarded.
It is important to note that these changes did not fundamentally alter the core of the game.
Pitchers still needed to execute good pitches, fielders still needed to defend, and hitters still needed to find ways to reach base.
However, the clock introduced a new layer of strategy and endurance.
Pitchers who could stay composed under time pressure gained an advantage, while those who struggled saw declines in performance.
Overall, the 2023 pitch clock rule represented a significant step in Major League Baseball’s effort to modernize the game.
By requiring faster play, the league hoped to make baseball more exciting without losing its essential character.
The early results suggest that the pitch clock achieved its main goals.
Games became shorter and more watchable.
Pitcher performance, while slightly affected in some areas, became more consistent overall.
As younger pitchers are trained with the clock in place, the adjustment period may disappear altogether.
Pitchers of the future will likely develop new strategies that embrace the faster tempo rather than exist with the faster style of play.
Major League Baseball’smove to implement the pitch clock shows how even a sport built on tradition can adapt thoughtfully, responding to both the needs of players and the expectations of a changing audience.
